with the purpose of offering real-world engineering experience to students from universities around the world. Student teams are challenged to design and manufacture a high-performance, single-seat off-road vehicle that is aimed at the recreational user market and conforms to the comprehensive Baja SAE rulebook. Along with the challenge of engineering the vehicle, teams must also secure financial support for their project while at the same time managing their educational priorities. Teams will then have their performance evaluated through four-day long competitions, which consist of a rigorous technical inspection to evaluate conformance to rules, design and sales presentations given to industry professionals, cost evaluation, several dynamic events, and a four-hour long wheel-to-wheel endurance race. Three official Baja SAE competitions are held in the United States each year in the spring and the CWRU Motorsports team aims to compete in each one to maximize the experience each member gains. The team will be competing in all three of the 2020 competitions, which will be held in Arizona, Louisville, and Illinois.  Detailed information for this year's events can be seen on the SAE International website."})]})}),s.jsx(g,{direction:"up",delay:.1,children:s.jsxs("div",{className:l.accomplishmentsSection,children:[s.jsx("h1",{className:l.accomplishmentsTitle,children:"THE TEAM'S GROWING LIST OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS"}),Re.map((e,t)=>s.jsx(Te,{year:e.year,competitions:e.competitions},t))]})})]}),s.jsx(X,{})]})}export{ge as default};
